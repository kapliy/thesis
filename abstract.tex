This thesis presents the measurement of \Wmn\ inclusive cross-sections based on proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7\tev$ with an integrated luminosity of \lumitr, collected with the ATLAS detector in 2011. The charge-dependent $W^{\pm}$ differential cross-sections are provided in bins of muon pseudorapidity as well as double differentially in muon pseudorapidity and muon transverse momentum. The data are also presented as integrated cross-sections, in the fiducial region of the measurement and extrapolated to full phase space. Results are compared to predictions computed at NNLO QCD for different NNLO sets of parton distribution functions. The \Wmn\ cross-sections are combined with complementary measurements in \Wen, \Zmm, and \Zee\ channels and used in a dedicated NNLO QCD analysis to obtain new constraints on the parton distributions in the proton.
